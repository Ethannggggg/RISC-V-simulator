# RISCV-LC Simulator
The RISC-V LC (Low Complexity) ISA simulator is a tool designed to emulate the RISC-V architecture, specifically targeting the LC subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture. 
RISC-V is an open standard for computer architecture that allows for extensibility and customization.

### The Key Features of a RISC-V LC Assembler:

- Low Complexity
- Instruction Set Emulation
- VCustomizability
- Educational Focus

## Get the RV321 Assembler

- git clone https://github.com/Ethannggggg/RISC-V-simulator.git

- cd RISC-V-simulator

- git checkout RISCV-LC-ISA-Simulator

## Run the assembler

### Assemble a RISC-V file and generate a binary
``` bash 
  ./sim [input.bin]
```
### Example:
```bash 
 ./sim benchmarks/isa.bin
```
- This is for checking the output machine code: isa.bin if you have implemented the assembler
