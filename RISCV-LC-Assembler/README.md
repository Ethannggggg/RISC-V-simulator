# RISCV-LC Assembler
A RISC-V LC Assembler is a lightweight, simplified assembler designed for the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), typically used in educational or embedded systems contexts. 
The "LC" often stands for "Little Computer" or "Low Complexity", indicating a minimalistic version of RISC-V tailored for learning or constrained environments.

### The Key Features of a RISC-V LC Assembler:

- Supports a Subset of RISC-V Instructions

- Simplified Synta

- Educational Use Case

- Lightweight Implementation

## Get the RV321 Assembler

- git clone https://github.com/Ethannggggg/RISC-V-simulator.git

- cd RISC-V-simulator

- git checkout RISCV-LC-Assembler

## Run the assembler

### Assemble a RISC-V file and generate a binary
- ./asm [input.asm] [output.bin]

### Example:
./asm benchmarks/isa.asm isa.bin

- This is for checking the output machine code: isa.bin if you have implemented the assembler
